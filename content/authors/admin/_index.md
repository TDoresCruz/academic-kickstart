Terence studies gossip in Bianca Beersma's ERC-Consolidator Grant Project [FORCE-OF-GOSSIP][]. Terence is also the student-representative for the [Kurt Lewin Institute][].

Broadly, Terence is interested in the role of gossip in human cooperative or uncooperative interactions, such as in social or organizational groups. Terence's current work focuses on the selfish or prosocial motives individual gossipers have, and how receivers of gossip react to gossip and attribute these motives to senders. In addition, Terence recently completed a large scale experience sampling study that describes gossip in daily life in light of indirect reciprocity and partner choice (in collaboration with the [Amsterdam Cooperation Lab][]).
